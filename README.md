### I want to...

#### Add a Page

1. Add a component in `/client/pages`
2. Add a route in `/client/routes/` where route.name = {YourComponent}

## But what if...

1. I don't need data fetching.

Cool ðŸ˜Ž.
Remove the apollo configuration from both `client/apollo` and `server/apollo`.

2. I want to use Redux

Great ðŸ™ƒ.
See step 1. Add Redux config in both `client/{redux_here}` and `server/{redux_here}`.
